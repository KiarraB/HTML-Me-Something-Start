            <p class="funParagraph">I can't speak for all of us, but I occasionally find myself wishing for a life different from my own. Life can be difficult. It can be uncomfortable, stressful, and sometimes it feels unfair or unjust. As kids, we would play "pretend," where we could do anything and be anyone we want. Well, what's something that us adults have to possibly feel that same sense of mysticality? Video games.</p>
            <p class="funParagraph">The video game that's been on the forefront of my mind recently is The Sims 3. The Sims 3 is a single-player life simulation game developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts (EA) where the player can create and control their own, personalized characters, develop towns and homes, and fashion a life separate from their own.</p>

            <h2>Unlimited Possibilities</h2>
            <p>I used to <em>love</em> playing pretend as a kid. Now that I'm older, The Sims 3 has become my game of "pretend." When I play The Sims 3, I can envision the life of anyone imaginable. I can raise the perfect (or most dysfunctional) family, I can choose any occupation, and easily gain simoleons&#8212;the in-game currency! It's basically a dollhouse for adults. We would be here a while if I even began to talk about mods and custom content&#8212a way to further personalize your gameplay.</p>
            <p>I've been playing The Sims 3 since I was 11 years old, so excuse me for my bias. The happiness when I play has never really went away. The only difference after 11 years of playing is that now I can actually build well.</p>

         <section><p>A tool that I've been spending a little too much time in is called Create A World. In this mode, you can literally create the entire world your sims will interact with. You can create the world <em>you</em> would like to live in.</p>

            <p>In this article, I will be explaining my own personal reasons for why The Sims 3 is <em>so</em> much better than The Sims 4.</p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h1>The Sims 3 Is Just Better In Almost Every Way</h1>
            <h2>Open World Concept</h2>
            <p>If I'm going to be playing a game, I'm not into it for short tidbits of dopamine. I'm in it for the long haul! The Sims 3 was the first game in the Sims franchise that introduced the open world concept. There are way less limitations than in a closed world. You aren't restricted to waiting on a loading screen just to go to a park or the beach&#8212and who wants to wait on loading screens?</p>
            <p>Instead of moving from house to house, neighborhood to neighborhood, etc, you could move anywhere within your Sims' towns! One sim could be at the park with your kids, another sim could be at home making dinner, and <em>another</em> sim could be at the beach getting a tan! Your sim can actually use the cars that they spend their hard-earned simoleons on! Your kids can go on bikes and ride across town if they wanted!</p>
            <p>While the open world concept <em>does</em> produce a lot of lag and bugs, I would say&#8212;gameplay-wise&#8212;that open world just creates so many possibilities that The Sims 4 could never live up to. Plus, there are many ways that you can reduce lag within the game now. So, if you aren't using a shared MacBook from 2005 (coming from personal experience), The Sims 3 is definitely playable.</p>
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>In The Sims 4, once again, EA decided to take some shortcuts in development for the sake of playability across all types of systems. In The Sims 4, adult sims are restricted to just <em>three</em> personality traits vs The Sims 3's five. I don't know about you, but I definitely have more than just three personality traits. These restrictions just add to the cheap lifelessness of The Sims 4. EA truly cut corners and dared to call it an upgrade. Along with that, The Sims 3 base game came with 63 traits you could choose from, while The Sims 4 downgraded to 53. This creates less variability within the game.</p>
            <h2>Microtransactions</h2>
            <p>Did you know that when The Sims 4 was released, there weren't even pools? This outraged fans of The Sims franchise so much that they finally added it in patch 7. While microtransactions were definitely a thing even back in The Sims 3 days, they weren't <em>required</em> to have a playable game. The Sims 3 had expansion packs and stuff packs. For The Sims 4, they added "game packs" and "kits," for even more microtransaction fun! Rather than making a playable game from the start, EA just decided to squeeze even more money out of their fans' pockets. These packs that The Sims 4 added have even less bang for your buck! There are fewer items for an even larger price tag. These expansion packs will cost you merely $39.99 vs The Sims 3's $19.99.</p>

            <h2>Create-A-Style and the Color Wheel</h2>
            <p>Adding to the vibrant versatility of The Sims 3, you were able to choose any color or pattern on any object or piece of clothing that you would like! The Sims 4 "simplified" that concept by forcing you to choose from "swatches" that come in limited, mismatched, basic colors.</p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>These are all personal opinions and should not be taken as if they're fact. There is definitely some bias at play here. Although, it makes me really sad to see the state of games today, where microtransactions are becoming the norm and you can just buy an unfinished product with the expectation to buy expansion packs for complete access to the game. This isn't just a Sims issue. More and more, games are being released incomplete with microtransactions to get ahead. Somehow, it's working, and people keep paying these companies money. So I'll be sticking with my Sims 3, and I won't be leaving until a better game is released.</p>
